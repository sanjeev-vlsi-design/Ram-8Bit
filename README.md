RAM 8-bit Module
This repository contains the conceptual overview and design details for an 8-bit Random Access Memory (RAM) module. The focus of this project is to understand and implement a simple memory block commonly used in digital design and VLSI systems.

Overview
RAM is a critical component in digital systems, used for temporary storage of data. The 8-bit RAM module described here is designed to demonstrate the principles of memory design, including read and write operations, memory addressing, and data storage.

Features
8-bit Data Width: Each memory location can store an 8-bit data value.
Configurable Depth: The memory depth (number of addresses) can be adjusted based on requirements.
Read/Write Operations: Supports reading from and writing to specific memory addresses.
Clock Synchronized: Read and write operations are synchronized with a clock signal, ensuring reliable operation.
Enable Signal: Includes a control signal to enable or disable the memory module.
Design Components
Address Decoder: Determines the specific memory location to access based on the input address.
Write Logic: Controls data writing to the specified address when the write enable signal is active.
Read Logic: Outputs data stored at the specified address when the read enable signal is active.
Control Signals:
Clock: Synchronizes all operations.
Write Enable (WE): Enables data writing.
Read Enable (RE): Enables data reading.
Chip Enable (CE): Activates the RAM for read/write operations.
